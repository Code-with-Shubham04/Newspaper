Welcome to aamchi Mumbai, Deepak Chahar!
Known for his deadly swing and clutch performances,
Chahar brings a unique spark to our team. The moment we bought the experienced bowler,
his iconic 6/7 against Bangladesh in 2019 flashed right in front of our eyes! In fact,
it remains the best T20I figures by an Indian bowler to date!!!
A versatile weapon in the powerplay and at the death, the pacer’s ability to deliver under pressure is unparalleled. 
Add to that, a lethal partnership alongside BOOM & Boulty would make him simply unstoppable!
Get ready, Paltan — Deepak Chahar is here to electrify Wankhede and take our bowling arsenal to the next level!
